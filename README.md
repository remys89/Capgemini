# Docker workshop

In front of you there is a laptop with Docker toolbox installed.
During the following exercises, you will learn to get along with Docker in the basic way of working, and be able to deploy small containers.
If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

## Basics

First, learn to get started with Docker after our presentation.
We are going to deploy a Busybox container on our docker environment.
Busybox is a small linux environment and a sandbox to play with.

- docker pull busybox

> $ docker pull busybox
> Using default tag: latest
> latest: Pulling from library/busybox


This way, we will download the image to our docker hypervisor so its ready for use in a container.
